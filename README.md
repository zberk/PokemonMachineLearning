# PokemonMachineLearning
This project is to help me learn how to learn Machine Learning through a meaningful, productive outlet: Pokemon! 

I'd like to give a huge shoutout to **phalt** for providing http://pokeapi.co and I hope you can contribute at [PokeAPI](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi/).
I would also like to thank **Porocyon** for providing us with PokeApi.NET which is available at [PokeApi.NET](https://gitlab.com/PoroCYon/PokeApi.NET).
